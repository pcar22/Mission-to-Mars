# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
Mission to Mars challenge is to add more polish to Robin's web app. Robin wanted all four of the hemisphere images.

## Images
Python, BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to scrape full-resolution images of Mars' hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to diplay the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images. The images below are from the dev tools to show mobile view and the image of the Mongo database.
